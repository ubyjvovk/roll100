**Roll100**

A minimalist web app that shows a random integer (0–99) updated every second. You can pause/resume auto-refresh or hit “Generate” for a one-off number.

Includes an optional color-coded gauge (green→red) and five themes (Light, Dark, System, Low Contrast, High Contrast). All controls live in a compact menu for a clutter-free view.

Deployable as a gh page (ok but bolt won't edit github actions hmmm)
